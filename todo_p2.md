### TODO

- [ ] <del> passer de Jump à Non linear solver </del>
- [ ] cout du curtailment non linéraire
- [ ] switch to gaussian distribution for transition probabilities (then discretize)
- [ ] make reinforcement learning for transition probabilities (added value)

### Improvements

- [ ] include electric vehicle charging schedules (added value to paper)
- [ ] relax reactive power control
- [ ] have flexible loads (demand goes to zero, similar to demand curtailment)
