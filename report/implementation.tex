\section{Implementation} % (fold)
\label{sec:implementation}
We decided to use the \textsc{Julia}
programming language as our coding partner.
Using \textsc{Julia} intuitive package generator, we were able to
produce beautiful documentation and we therefore invite
the reader to have a look at the \textsc{html} documentation located
in the folder \texttt{html\_doc/} by opening the \texttt{index.html} file.
The latter contains a structured presentation of the architecture
of our code as well as a description of each function.

Note also that we used \textsc{JuMP}, a modelling language (\cite{DunningHuchetteLubin2017}) for \textsc{Julia}, for the optimization models.
The models have been solved with the commercial solver \textsc{CPLEX} for which free academic licenses are available.
