% - It would be nice to compare the performance of your reinforcement learning (RL) or Markov decision process (MDP) model to some naive baseline policies based on heuristic rules. These rules are the one you would adopt when playing yourself the game (or controlling the system).
% Then the question is "Does RL or MDP perform better than the baseline strategy ?" Experimental simulations/comparisons should be carried out in order to answer this question.
