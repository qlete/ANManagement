\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:objective}

In this work, our objective will be to compare this new reinforcement learning framework for active network management to a more classical framework based on mathematical optimization.
We will compare the two methods on the three following points :
\begin{itemize}
\item Execution time and computational complexity.
\item Assumptions and scope of the model.
\item Experimental results.
\end{itemize}
