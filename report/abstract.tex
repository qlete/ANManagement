\begin{abstract}
In this work, we present a new application of Reinforcement Learning for solving the problem of Active Network Management of electricity distribution networks with large amount of solar production.
Based on exisiting models, we show how this problem can be written as a Markov Decision Process.
We then present a model-free Reinforcement Learning algorithm and apply it on a real distribution with realistic demand and PV production profiles.
Finally, we compare the results and efficiency of our RL model to a multi-time-steps optimization model.
