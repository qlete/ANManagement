\section{Conclusion and further work} % (fold)
\label{sec:further_work}
% The work will be based on scientific papers or books and should contain both a theoretical contribution (description of the method) as well as an empirical validation. The balance between the two components depends on your wish and expectation: the orientation of the work can be more theoretical or more practical. If, for instance, you decide to face a complex application, you can limit yourself to a description of the basic algorithms you used (MDP, RL or BP). Conversely, if you decide to study a theoretical extension, the practical application can just be the “Snakes and Ladders” game investigated in the first project.


We designed a new layout for seeing nodes as uncertainty and edges as actions
regarding which houses to consider.

Might be interesting to see what happens what a lot of houses
are into the game as well as more choice in the rate of curtailment.
